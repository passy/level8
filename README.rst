==================
Stripe CTF Level 8
==================

My script to crack the level 8 of the Stripe CTF Challenge 2012. In order to run
this, you have to adjust the ``SERVER_HOST`` to your level 2 server you put the
script on. You may also want to adjust the ``CONFIRMATIONS`` value to a
reasonable number. 3 works fine, but may take a really long time on an
overloaded server.

Other than that, just copy it onto the server, run::

    ./level8.py

and grab a cup of coffee. Enjoy.
